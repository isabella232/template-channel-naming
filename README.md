> git clone https://github.com/slackapi/template-channel-naming.git

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-channel-naming-blueprint)

1. Enable the interactive messages (See below *Enable Interactive Messages*)
1. Enable events (See below *Enable the Events API*)

#### Enable Interactive Messages

1. Click on **Events Subscriptions** and enable events.
1. Set the Request URL to your server (*e.g.* `https://yourname.ngrok.com`) or Glitch URL + `/events`
1. On the same page, scroll down to *Subscribe to Bot Events* and subscribe to the `channel_created` and `channel_rename` events.


## Run this App

Set Environment Variables and run:

1. Set the following environment variables in `.env` (copy from `.env.sample`):
    * `SLACK_TOKEN`: Your app's `xoxb-` token (available on the Install App page)
    * `SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`: Your app's Verification Token (available on the Basic Information page)
1. If you're running the app locally, run the app (`npm start`). Or if you're using Glitch, it automatically starts the app.
